Recent visit to a large, modern, metropolitan area confirmed a theory.

A suspicion that has been building and partially tested over the years.

I have become a country mouse than a city mouse.

> A **country mouse** invites his cousin, the **city mouse**, to visit his humble rural home. The country mouse offers simple food like grains and roots. The city mouse scoffs at the plain lifestyle and invites the country mouse to experience the luxuries of city living.
>
> When the country mouse visits, he is impressed by the rich food in the city, but terrified by the constant dangers—such as dogs and humans. After several close calls, the country mouse decides he would rather live a quiet and safe life than enjoy luxuries filled with fear.

-   Aesop's Fable

All of the modern conveniences were present.

Clean, well organized streets with buses and subways that served virtually all parts of the city.

Law abiding citizens, adding to the sense of well being and safety.

Modern office and apartment buildings that housed hundreds if not thousand persons in a single edifice.

Places that will satisfy basics as well as un-stated needs in an instant.

In fact, the only thing missing were more customers that will consume all of the material goods that were readily available all over of this metropolitan area.

There were few things that I needed coaching up to become more like the citizen of this city.

Like navigating the maze of the underground transportation system. Calling taxis using the new peer to peer network. Ordering food through installed kiosks at each table.

In time, I would become more proficient and could mimic being a local person.

However, there was one trend that proved to be difficult to overlook.

Tasks in big city were mostly transactional.

No room, or more accurately no time for getting personal or have a human interaction.

In an area, covered with as if 人山人海, I felt alone. Tides of people in the morning and even more people in the evening hours.

I would not know how to adjust to this setting where people appear to congregate and get things done, then retire to their areas of refuge, into their cubicles in the sky.

I could adjust, but given a choice, I will take a small town with its inconveniences over a big town living.

談的談 說的說\
小城故事真不錯\
請你的朋友一起來\

Talking here, and chatting there,\
Small town stories are so fine.\
Bring your friends along with you,\
Come and spend some time.
