Visited a place where food was fit for Goldilocks.

It wasn't too spicy, too salty, but just right.

Took many photos, some came out better than I expected.

In fact, all of them were technically just right, as algorithm dictated it to be.

Didn't have to make any travel plans.

Hosts took care of it, I just had to be ready and they chauffeured me from places to places using the latest navigation tools.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

During the visit, I didn't get lost -- while we were with locals.

Consequently, I never learned how to figure out directions or where I was visiting.

By looking at metadata on photos, I could retrace places I visited.

In the days past, I would be asking directions even after planning with physical maps.

Looking for landmarks, such as banks or natural indicators that provides directional anchors.

Also studying the sun's position aided in determining the direction in the absence of landmarks such as mountains.

This approach was mistake-prone but after a day or so, one usually figured out the lay of the land.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

One rainy afternoon, I ventured out on my own.

Initial thinking was that I could locate palaces, since most landmarks remained same in that part of town.

I miscalculated.

My assistant was the locally made, on-line map, which had details often lacking multi-purpose maps made outside the country.

However, since I couldn't figure out my current location, the e-Maps were not as helpful.

To figure out the immediate location, I had to move about, which was difficult to notice on a small phone screen.

Finally resorted to asking people where I needed to go.

Some were friendly and some were helpful, some were neither.

At last, tried the strategy of following tourists to the tourist destination.

Food was not only presented well and flavored ideally, but also there were over abundance of it.

Growing up, food was scarce and meals were served plain.

We mostly ate vegetables, fishes and occasional meat-enhanced soups.

Food was local and seldom got to taste cuisine from other locations

We tasted meat, a couple times a year, usually during holidays or birthdays of older people.

On this trip, we got to sample food from all regions of the country, while in the capital city.

Special occasion food was available on-demand, all hours of the day.

One could eat food from days gone by as well as order food that was from other countries.

At a wedding banquet, the buffet line featured 5 separate offerings.

A line of traditional Korean food, followed by seafood selection, fruit and salad, and dessert.

An hour and half allotted time was not enough to sample all the food and to visit with relatives.\^\[in the wedding venues, scheduled are tightly set and each couple has 30 to 40 minutes to use the main hall and guests are directed to the dining hall afterwards, before the next couple starts their cycle of activities\]

Chose to visit with relatives, for some it was nearly 30 years since we last saw them.

The society had transformed from scarcity and inconvenient mode to one of utmost abundance and comfort.

During 50 years, the pace of growth and transformation has been remarkable.

Kudos to the people of Korea their achievements that borders on miracle.

As an observer of the change, it seemed that in days of past, one was faced with daily challenges and inconvenience.

Lack of food and walk to nearly all places.

In the present day, there are more food than the population 2 or 3 times can consume.

In addition, one has to look for ways to exercise, to find a way to walk to places and and try to get lost and try the personal navigation skills rather than rely on electronic help.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Not to suggest that those days were preferable to present day.

Days of poverty, hunger and physical demands

But in some ways, discomfort, pain and hardship allowed for and provided comparison and appreciation.

And perhaps a slow build up of character.

Is there a way to accomplish it, during these Goldilocks days?
