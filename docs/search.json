    "text": "손자(孫子):\nHi Grandpa, came across some digital photos from the year of the Snake (乙巳)1.\nWasn’t this the period when you were slowing down and transitioning from company funded trips?\nThe photos told a different story.\nOlder Me:\nThat was the year the oldest of your maternal uncles got married, Uncle JH.\nYes, that was post company sponsored travel days. And I thought of taking things slower but your grandma had other ideas.\nShe was invited to the wedding in Korea and scheduled to travel there.\nBut I wasn’t – initially.\nLike many things in life, women’s willpower changes the outcome.\nSoon, I was making travel plans and thinking of people and places to meet and visit.\n손자(孫子):\nSo how did you go about detailed planning? Without specifics of business trips.\nOlder Me:\nWe have visited Korea a number of times, but this was the first time only 2 of us traveled.\nAt that time we had sold the business that required the attention of grandma. Because I was working at the time, chose a 10-day visit duration. Planned around the wedding.\nThat opened up many options and possibilities.\nIn addition, a direct flight to Incheon, Korea, had begun just few weeks prior to the visit.2\nI had a number of aunts and uncle that were in their 80s and 90s.\nMy mother’s younger siblings in Korea were, 90 and 87.\nMy father’s youngest brother was 82.\nMy mother’s church friend was 90.\nVisiting them was my priority.\nPlus I wanted to visit my hometown 인천(仁川).\nThe remaining time would be spent either shopping or visiting sites around the country.\nI didn’t know how we could do all of this in 10 days.\nWe decided to visit 서울성전 at the beginning and at the end of our visit.\nAnd met with the uncle and aunts, the first 4 days we were in Korea.\n손자(孫子):\nI do remember stories about your aunts and uncles.\nI am glad you kept in touch with them over the years.\nHow did you get in touch with Grandma’s friends, after she had passed away?\nOlder Me:\nWe formed a group, LLJK, (이이정강).\nWe first met in 인천, during the early days of the Church in the area.\nWe had maintained our friendship with the help of the group chat.\nAll but L1 had moved to the States, when I told L2 and J that I would be traveling to Korea, they suggested I get in touch with L1, who lived in 마포 area of 서울\nL2 warned me that there aren’t many people that would remember me and advised me to visit and enjoy the local food.\nL1 met me on a day that was 90+ degrees Farenheit and same amount of humidity.\nI wanted to meet my aunt first and then tour the town.\nI wondered why he kept avoiding a lunchtime rendenvous\nAs a compromise, we met at 9AM at 동인천역(東仁川駅)\nBy 10AM the weather was brutal, I was struggling with the heat and the hilly streets\nAs we walked, L1 rehearsed the history and people associated with the church in Incheon (인천)\nStarted in 중앙동, in a rented, converted 2-story building. Recall, one of the floor had a tatami (畳) floor.\nThen a government property3 in 답동 was purchased and the existing building was renovated for church use.\nSubsequently a new building was built on site. Eventually, all of the 인천 area wards were combined into a single meeting house in 주안.\n손자(孫子):\nQuite a day. You were lucky that L2 was available and willing to take you to places. How did it feel to walk around the places of birth and growth?\nOlder Me:\nThings had changed dramatically in last 50 years. Except for few places that hadn’t changed, it was like many other places in modern Korea. Vertical growth and no green areas. Almost a feeling of visiting a foreign country.\nExcept, the memories of people and experiences. Meetings and activities in the old chapel.\nFriends that still remember who I was and accept me as who I have become.\n손자(孫子):\nSo did you visit your old church on Sunday?\nOlder Me:\nYes, I visited 인천1와드. That Ward was composed of the former, 답동, 송도, 주안 Wards\nAs we were driving towards the new building, I related the conversion story of my mother.\nShe had studied with the missionaries for nearly 2 years. But she still had some questions. She wrote them down.\nWhen Harold B. Lee visited Korea and my mother attended the fireside All of mother’s questions were answered by the visiting general authority. Mom’s mind was set to join the church - intellectually\nThen one afternoon, she dreamed a dream.\nIn the dream, there were 2 books. She could tell they were the Bible and the Book of Mormon. And a hand appeared and pointing to 2 books and touching them one by one said\nShe was ready to be baptized.\n손자(孫子):\nThanks for sharing that. So did anyone recognize you?\nOlder Me:\nL2 was correct, in a congregation of nearly 150 people only 3 people knew me. L2’s mother. L1’s sister and her husband.\nI wondered if this will be similar to how we will be welcomed into the next life. There will be we may know and recognize but only a few would personally escort us through.\nThat person this time was L2’s mom.\nShe recounted how she and my mother served in the Stake Primary Presidency, without really understandint the calling.\nThen she recounted my mother’s dream about the hand and 2 books. Almost word for word.\nMy testimony was strengthened. I had come home to my and my family’s Bountiful.\nThank you members of the 인천 area. In particular, thank you Sister 임윤님, Brother 유관종, Sister 이강주. For remembering me, welcoming me, and confirming the faith of my parents."

    "text": "Appendix B: AI Explanation of 한옥\n한옥(韓屋)은 한국의 전통적인 건축 양식으로 지어진 집을 의미합니다. 주로 나무, 흙, 돌, 짚 등을 사용하여 지어지며, 온돌, 대청마루 등 특징적인 구조를 가지고 있습니다. 넓은 의미로는 초가집, 너와집 등 모든 전통 가옥을 포함하지만, 일반적으로는 기와집 형태의 한옥을 떠올리는 경우가 많습니다. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\n한옥의 특징:\n• 온돌: 구들을 이용해 바닥 난방을 하는 한국 고유의 난방 방식입니다. [7, 7, 8, 8]\n• 대청마루: 거실과 같이 넓은 공간으로, 여름철 시원하게 지낼 수 있는 공간입니다. [7, 7, 9, 9, 10, 11, 12]\n• 처마: 지붕의 끝 부분이 건물 밖으로 길게 뻗어 나와 여름철 햇볕을 가려주고 겨울철에는 눈과 비를 막아줍니다. [7, 7, 13, 13]\n• 자연과의 조화: 풍수지리 사상에 따라 자연 환경과 조화를 이루도록 지어지며, 뒤로는 산을 등지고 앞으로는 물을 바라보는 방향으로 짓는 것이 일반적입니다. [1, 1, 14, 14]\n한옥의 종류:\n• 초가집: 짚으로 지붕을 이은 집입니다. • 너와집: 나무 판자를 엮어 지붕을 이은 집입니다. • 기와집: 기와로 지붕을 이은 집입니다. [5, 5, 7, 7]\n한옥의 장점:\n• 친환경적인 건축 재료: 나무, 흙, 돌 등 자연 재료를 사용하여 건강하고 쾌적한 주거 환경을 제공합니다. [2, 2, 5, 5]\n• 온돌 난방 시스템: 겨울철 따뜻하고 편안한 난방을 제공합니다. [2, 2, 8, 8, 15]\n• 자연과의 조화: 주변 환경과 잘 어울리고 자연의 변화를 느낄 수 있습니다. [1, 1, 14, 14, 16, 17, 18]\n• 독특한 아름다움: 전통적인 선과 구조에서 나오는 아름다움을 가지고 있습니다. [13, 13, 19, 19]\n최근 한옥의 변화: 최근에는 현대적인 생활 방식에 맞춰 한옥을 개량하거나 새로운 한옥을 짓는 시도가 이루어지고 있습니다. 전통적인 요소를 유지하면서 편리성을 높이고, 현대적인 디자인을 가미하여 새로운 형태의 한옥이 등장하고 있습니다.
